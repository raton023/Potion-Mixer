# Potion-Mixer
to mix on cauldron a lot of potions
this is an older version, a diferent version of the Witch Potions.
it has potions that can have a lot of potions in them, but it has this 2 bugs:
1 when a splash potion has more than 10 potions in it, the lore behaves in uncommon ways.
2 the sulphur must be mixed to get a splash potion this is not a bug but I guess witches dont use
drinkable potions so I decide to remove drinked potions, all the potions that get mixed on the Cauldron
gives splashes potions.
